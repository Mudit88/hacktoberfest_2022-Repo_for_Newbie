First, you need to have a local repository for your actual project code. (If you already have this, then follow the procedure)
Open the command line ("Terminal" on the Mac, "Git Bash" on Windows) and change into your project's base directory. There, you can create a new Git repository:

Steps for Contributing

$ cd projects/my-project           


$ git init                          


$ git add .                          


$ git commit -m "Initial commit"     


$ git remote add origin <remote repository URL>      
  
  
$ git push origin master
